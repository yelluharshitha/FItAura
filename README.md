Digital Wellness Assistant – Backend (FastAPI + Groq + Multi-Agent System)

This backend powers an AI-driven Digital Wellness Assistant that provides personalized wellness guidance using a hands-off multi-agent architecture built with FastAPI, LangChain, Groq LLM, and MySQL.

The system helps users with:

Symptoms (fatigue, dizziness, headache, etc.)

Diet guidance

Fitness improvements

Lifestyle habits (sleep, routine, stress)

The backend automatically chooses which agent to use based on LLM reasoning, NOT rule-based or keyword matching.

Features
*User Authentication

Signup (email + password)

Login with JWT authentication

Secure password hashing

Google Auth ready

*User Profile

Each user can set:

Age

Gender

Weight + Height

Diet Type (Veg / Non-Veg / Vegan / Eggitarian)

Activity Level

Sleep Hours

Health Conditions

This stored profile helps the system give personalized suggestions.

*Hands-Off Multi-Agent Architecture

The assistant uses four specialized agents:

Agent	Purpose
SymptomAgent	Understand physical/mental symptoms & give relief tips
DietAgent	Provide diet, nutrition, hydration, protein suggestions
FitnessAgent	Fix workout issues, gym routines, muscle gain problems
LifestyleAgent	Manage sleep, stress, habits, routine

A Supervisor LLM decides:

Which agent should run

How many agents are needed

When to stop (FINISH)

No keyword-based logic is used — everything is decided through LLM reasoning.

 How It Works (Backend Flow)
1.User signs up / logs in

Auth system creates a user in the database.

2.User creates their profile

Stored in MySQL and used in all future responses.

3.User sends a wellness query

Example:

“I feel dizzy during workouts.”

4.Supervisor LLM decides which agent to call

For example:

SymptomAgent (dizziness)

DietAgent (pre-workout food)

FitnessAgent (intensity issues)

5.Agents generate short, practical suggestions

Then the supervisor may call another agent if needed.

6.Chat API returns final JSON
{
  "response": "Your advice here...",
  "agents_used": ["SymptomAgent", "DietAgent"]
}
